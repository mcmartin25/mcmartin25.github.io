        <p>Slogan from Chor Tsun Lam Media LTD. YouTube Channel</p>

        <p>Hello there. I'm Martin C. (Chor Tsun Lam), a junior programmer who live in Hong Kong. I'm interested in programming and filming, interested to create some ideas that I can’t be created within my ability, like karaoke system, operating system, etc., and I'm a console UI lover.</p>

        <p>I have the ability to create good videography and photography. I joined the school campus TV in my half of my secondary school life. After graduation and admitted to an institute college in 2017, I started to learn about programming and my first programming language I learned was Visual Basic.net, which makes me interested into programming. At the same time, I still study about some advanced video and photography skills.</p>

        <p>In 2010, I started to be a YouTuber to remaking some music videos by adding lyrics subtitle on them. However, one of my video was totally blocked due to copyright infringement. Since then, my impression of copyright has deteriorated.</p>

        <p>I have a great level of knowledge and understanding in coding skills and coding logic. I know how to code in VB.net and Java. I can code for my apps almost all the day. It's good for me to learn more advanced programming languages in the future, even it has been said that: It is never too old to learn.</p>

        <p>Also, I can make websites using some of the most commonly used library, such as jQuery, Bootstrap, and other JavaScript-based libraries, like moment.js.</p>

        <p>In the past 2-3 years, I have tried to help translating some YouTube videos when I'm free, as well as localizing some projects on localization site.</p>

        <p>Just want to tell you I like programming so much but it's hard to say.</p>
