<p class="text-muted">Me in 2011.</p>

Hello there. I'm Martin who live in Hong Kong. I'm interested in programming and filming, love to create some ideas that I canâ€™t be created within my ability, like karaoke system, operating system, etc., and like learning new things on computers. P.S. I'm a console UI lover.

I help localizing some projects to maintain their language integrity, as well as maintain my project code seldomly when I'm free. Besides, watching videos about Technology and Vintage Computers on YouTube, listening 70's to 90's music, photographing, pointless posting (#jk) are also my thing.
